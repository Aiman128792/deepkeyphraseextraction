I/O-efficient dynamic planar point location.
We present an I/O-efficient dynamic data structure for point location in a general planar subdivision. Our structure uses O(N/B) disk blocks of size B to store a subdivision of size N. Queries can be answered in O(logB2N) I/Os in the worst-case, and insertions and deletions can be performed in O(logB2N) and O(logBN) I/Os amortized, respectively. Part of our data structure is based on an external version of the so-called logarithmic method that allows for efficient dynamization of static external-memory data structures with certain characteristics. Another important part of our structure is an external data structure for vertical ray-shooting among line segments in the plane with endpoints on B lines, developed using an external version of dynamic fractional cascading. We believe that these methods could prove helpful in the development of other dynamic external memory data structures.
