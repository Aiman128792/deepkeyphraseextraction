On learning monotone DNF under product distributions.
We show that the class of monotone 2O(logn)-term DNF formulae can be PAC learned in polynomial time under the uniform distribution from random examples only. This is an exponential improvement over the best previous polynomial-time algorithms in this model, which could learn monotone o(log2 n)-term DNF. We also show that various classes of small constant-depth circuits which compute monotone functions are PAC learnable in polynomial time under the uniform distribution. All of our results extend to learning under any constant-bounded product distribution.
